### BLOG POSTS

We already downloaded all these. You can find them in data/raw/scraped_data/articles/cleaned_articles. These are in Slovak language.

### FORUM

https://jaroslavlachky.sk/forum/ We need to scrape this. Because the resulting project is going to be an LLM like chatbot, it would be interesting to be able to evaluate similarity between the question being asked and a question in the forum and then give the answer a higher score. Also the answers of the author himself Jaroslav Lachk√Ω should have higher score. Discussions where the author is not involved should not be considered. Suggest an approach to this.

### Books

In pdf format. These contain a lot of pictures. These should also be indexed and we should create a tool to be able to describe them so that later they can be retrieved. It should be possible to show an image as an answer to a query.

### Videos and Podcasts

We need to transcribe all videos and podcasts to text so they are searchable later. These will be in Slovak language. Also the author is being asked questions so similar approach as in the forum should be taken.

### Scientific Articles and Books

These will have a lot of specialized, scientific knowledge that will support the claims made by the author. They will be in English language.
